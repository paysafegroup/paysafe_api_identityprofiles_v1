# Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

  * Key Username – MerchantXYZ
  * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

Note this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.
The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

  1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
  2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
  3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

  **Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

<a name="recipientobject" title="recipient Object"></a>
## recipient

When you add recipient data to a profile, that data will be used in the authorization request if you use the payment token from a credit card associated with that profile.

The recipient is deemed to be the person or party who has the contractual relationship with the merchant/financial institution. This may be different from the cardholder, e.g., in the case of a parent topping up a child's savings account. Therefore, the fields should not be collected on the same page as cardholder information, but instead be passed in the background from the merchant’s records.

**Note:** You can include *recipient* elements in your [authorization request](#authrequest) **only if** your Merchant Category Code is **6012** and your registered trading address is in the United Kingdom. All fields are optional. However, scheme fines may apply if data is consistently not supplied and chargebacks persist. If you have any questions, contact your account manager.

# Using the example API calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right hand pane. 
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint.
You must update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log into the test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
Click *View Base 64 Encoded* and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.
