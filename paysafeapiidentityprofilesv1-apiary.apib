# Overview

The Paysafe Customer Identity API allows merchants to perform KYC (know your customer) Customer Identity checks on their customers with a single request to the API. [Click here to see an overview](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/additional-documentation/customer-identity-checks/introduction-to-customer-identity-api/) of how this API works.

# Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

  * Key Username – MerchantXYZ
  * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

Note that this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.
The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

  1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
  2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
  3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

  **Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

# Testing Instructions

The Paysafe Test environment can be used to test applications without running transactions through the Production (live) system. Requests processed in the Test environment are not sent to live downstream providers, but through a simulator. Depending on the information provided with the transaction request, the simulator returns either a successful (approved) or failed (declined) response.

With the Paysafe API you can test the following:

* Verify support for all the operation types that you require.
* Review all common errors as well as errors that may occur for each operation, and ensure your application can handle them.
* Verify the lengths and format for all attributes you send.

# Using the example API calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right-hand pane. 
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint.
You must update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log in to the test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
Click **View Base 64 Encoded** and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.
